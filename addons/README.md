## addons, in case someone cares ðŸ”Œ <br>
I made a rounded bar snippet but I had too many problems, and I decided to remove it from the original theme, if someone still want it, it's here, just use the import, keep in mind its kinda weird when replying messages, and I used another snippet for the old messages bar, but I appreciate if someone has a better solution for that, just make an issue or something like that, I don't know too much about github amd PRs <br>
```css
@import url('https://ZeyLogger.github.io/lunar.theme/addons/RoundMessageBar.css');
```
### as an extra (this isn't made by me, I just edited it a bit) <br>
here is a message bubble snippet I took from Discord11, I just changed the color of the replied message, you can mess arround with it
```css
@import url("https://zuzumi-f.github.io/Discord-11/release/messagebubbleleft.css");

#app-mount .repliedMessage-3Z6XBG {
  background-color: var(--background-tertiary);
}
```
